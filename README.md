## üöÄ Features

### Current Functionality

1. **Add Entries**:
    
    - Store credentials including `username`, `service`, and `password` securely.
    - Each entry is assigned a unique ID automatically.
2. **List Entries**:
    
    - View all stored entries in a simple list format.
    - Passwords can be toggled for visibility.
3. **Edit Entries**:
    
    - Update existing credentials by specifying the entry ID.
4. **Delete Entries**:
    
    - Remove an entry permanently using its ID.
5. **Toggle Password Visibility**:
    
    - Show or hide passwords for individual entries.
6. **Archive Support**:
    
    - Save and load your credentials to/from a secure `.arc` file format.
    - Uses **PBKDF2** for key derivation and **Salsa20** for encryption.
    - Compresses data for efficient storage.

## üìñ How It Works

### Password Manager (In-Memory Operations)

The program operates with an in-memory structure for managing credentials:

- **`PasswordManager`**: A structure containing a list of entries and a counter for generating unique IDs.

#### Methods:

- **Add Entry**: Call the `add_entry` method with `username`, `service`, and `password` to add a new record.
    
- **List Entries**: The `list_entries` method retrieves a list of all entries. Passwords are hidden by default.
    
- **Edit Entry**: Update an entry by providing the ID along with the new details.
    
- **Delete Entry**: Remove an entry by its ID using the `delete_entry` method.
    
- **Toggle Password Visibility**: Use the `toggle_show_password` method with an entry ID to show or hide the password for that entry.

### Archive System (File-Based Storage)

The archive system provides secure file-based storage for credentials.

#### Save Process:

1. Entries are serialized into JSON format.
2. Data is compressed using zlib.
3. A unique salt is generated for key derivation.
4. The passphrase is used with PBKDF2 to derive a 256-bit encryption key.
5. Data is encrypted using Salsa20.
6. The file is saved with a header (magic bytes, version), salt, and encrypted data.

#### Load Process:

1. The `.arc` file is validated using the header.
2. Salt is read to regenerate the encryption key from the passphrase.
3. Data is decrypted and decompressed.
4. Entries are reconstructed from the JSON data.

## üõ†Ô∏è Planned Features

This project is in its early stages of development. Here‚Äôs what‚Äôs coming:

- **Enhanced Security**:
    
    - [ ] Password History Tracking: Store a secure history of old passwords to prevent reusing them accidentally.
    - [ ] Breach Monitoring: Notify users if their passwords or services are part of known data breaches using APIs like HaveIBeenPwned.
    - [ ] Customizable Password Policies: Allow users to define minimum password lengths, complexity requirements, and expiration periods.
    - [ ] Idle Lock Mechanism: Automatically lock the app after a period of inactivity.
- **Additional Features**:
    
    - [ ] Batch Import/Export:
        - [ ] Import passwords from other password managers (CSV, JSON).
        - [ ] Export passwords securely for backups or migration.
    - [ ] User Roles and Permissions: Allow shared accounts with controlled access for families or teams.
    - [ ] Multiple Vaults: Create separate vaults for personal, work, or shared accounts.
    - [ ] Color-Coded Categories: Assign categories or tags to entries for better organization.
    - [ ] Light/Dark Mode: User interface theme toggle for better usability.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer

This is a **rudimentary password manager** and not yet production-ready. While the current implementation uses strong encryption practices, use it cautiously and avoid storing sensitive credentials until the project matures further.
